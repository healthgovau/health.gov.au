        Note: Rates of exclusive breastfeeding were reported up to each month of age (eg
        an infant who received fluids other than breast milk at 5 months of age was exclusively breastfed for &lt;6
        months). Any breastfeeding was reported at &lt;1 month (age 0) and then in completed months.
